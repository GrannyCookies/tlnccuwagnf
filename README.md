# The Language Nobody Could Come Up With A Good Name For

*(Pronounced "Tul-un-qweh-wag-nuf", Tulun for short)*

This is a fork of liam4's [tlnccuwagnf](https://github.com/liam4/tlnccuwagnf) that adds (and changes!) many things.

It's one of those silly interpret-on-the-go programming languages that don't compile to bytecode (instead, it interprets in Node.js). This means it's probably much less efficient than, like, any other programming language.

It's a functional programming language (i.e. functions are first class).

It doesn't make sense. Please ignore the fact that it doesn't make sense? Also, hide, far, far away from the source code. It might lash out and hurt somebody's brain.
